1. First, open the repository on Github in your editor.
2. Next, choose a local repository location on your file system for local changes.
3. Create a local branch of the repository to make your changes to prevent code in process from corrupting production 
    code. Use a meaningful name that helps identify the feature to be added such as "Add-webpage"
4. Publish the branch to Github
5. Once in the new branch, make any changes to the files.
6. During development, stage and commit changes when they are working into your local repository in the file system.
7. When all edits are finally complete, go to Github and open a pull request.
8. Once pull request is reviewed and validated by the team, merge branch into master branch
9. Delete the working branch in Github.
10. In the IDE, pull the latest changes in the master branch.
